The repository is called deepQN despite my decision to move away from non-linear problems since they took to long to train. 

yahtzee.py contains my implementation of the game of yahtzee (closer to YamSlam)
the train_something.py files contain implementations of reinforcement learning
with some variation like models used. a few of them were unsuccessful.
